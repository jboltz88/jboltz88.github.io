title: Thoughts on Progress and Learning
---
It's been roughly six months now since I initially took the plunge into the deep end of software development. I've grown a lot through building web applications with languages such as Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, but it's started to realize that my thirst for knowledge may never be fully quenched.

I feel like I'm climbing a mountain of information, and at it's peak lies the title of "Expert" for all who reach it. Unfortunately after six months of learning software development, I still feel like I'm only a couple steps up the mountain. It makes me wonder who can ever really say they've arrived at "expert" status when information is seemingly always changing and advancing, and there's already so much out there. 

In between projects, I've been spending a lot of my spare time reading and listening to podcasts for anything and everything to do with software development. 

>*best practices, new languages, which development stack is the best, how to add certain features to my web apps, how to market myself, what new areas is tech expanding into, how to land your first job as a developer, how to get unstuck in what I'm currently working on...*

The list goes on.

The limitless stream of material could go on and on, and after reading it, I really don't have much to *show* for it. This is where most of my stress has come from lately. If I'm not constantly building something, I have nothing to show for all the learning I'm doing. As someone who is actively looking for his first position as a full-stack developer, not being able to showcase everything I know can be a problem.

The next few weeks will have a focus on software engineering principles such as data structures, algorithms and complexity, and framework architecture. So here's hoping for a few more steps up the mountain.
